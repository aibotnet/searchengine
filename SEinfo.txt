basic steps
-------------------
1.  Tokenizing
2.  Parsing
3.  Normalization
    --capitalization
    --synonymous database(color == colour)
    --handling abbreviation(DSLR ==DigitalSLR, in == ")
4.stemming
   (play ,playing , played)

4.lemmatization
    (Lemmatisation in linguistics, is the process of grouping together the different inflected
    forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item.In computational linguistics,
    lemmatisation is the algorithmic process of determining the lemma for a given word. Since
    the process may involve complex tasks such as understanding context and determining the part
    of speech of a word in a sentence (requiring, for example, knowledge of the grammar of a language)
    it can be a hard task to implement a lemmatiser for a new languag)
