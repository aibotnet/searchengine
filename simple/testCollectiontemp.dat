<title>10G-EPON</title>
<text>The term '''10G-EPON''' refers to '''10 Gbit/s Ethernet Passive Optical Network''' standard, [[IEEE]] 802.3av<ref>[http://www.ieee802.org/3/av/ IEEE P802.3av Task Force]</ref>. The standard supports two configurations: ''symmetric'', operating at 10 Gbit/s data rate in both upstream and downstream directions, and ''asymmetric'', operating at 10 Gbit/s in the downstream direction and 1 Gbit/s in the upstream direction.

== Standardization Timeline ==
In March 2006, IEEE 802.3 working group held call for interest (CFI) for 10 Gbit/s EPON study group. According to the CFI materials, representatives from the following companies supported the formation of the study group<ref>[http://www.ieee802.org/3/cfi/0306_1/cfi_0306_1.pdf "10Gb/s PHY for EPON - Call For Interest Presentation]</ref>:
