        <font face="Arial" size="4">
            A search engine is a software program or script available through the Internet that searches documents and files for keywords and returns the results of any files
            containing those keywords. The first search engine ever developed is considered Archie, which was used to search for FTP files and the first text-based search
            engine is considered Veronica.Because large search engines contain millions and sometimes billions of pages, many search engines not only just search the pages
            but also display the results depending upon their importance. This importance is commonly determined by using various algorithms.

          <font face="Arial" size="3">We have introduced a PRODUCT MATCHING algorithm which does web scraping. The algorithm acts as a crawler i.e. it crawls different websites chosen by us. Then according to the technique implemented, the algorithm finds if the product that we are looking for is available at the chosen site or not. <br><br>

          If available, the algorithm matches the products available at that website with our product. It then calculates the matching percentage of the found product with our product to be sure about the product found that it is in fact the product that we were looking for. If the product is matched, then reviews for that product are extracted.</font><br>

          <font size="5" style="color:darkblue;">Project Overview</font><font size="5"><br></font>
          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            To start with, i have taken a few categories as sample from which the products will be chosen, they are:
          </font>
          </br><br>
            Electronics<br><br>
            Appliances<br><br>
            Computers<br><br>
          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            A few domains corresponding to each category mentioned above are chosen as sample so that our product can be searched on these websites and if found, reviews will be extracted from them.<br><br>

            Products are chosen from Nextag website. Their information is taken from the company database, whatever is required to search them on the sample websites, and a search is made on those sites. According to the search results, first few links of the search result are considered and product matching algorithm is applied on the products found on first few links to check whether the product found in the search results is what we needed or not. If there are no results found for the product that was searched then we move on to the next product for that website.
          </font><br><br>

          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            If the product matches with our product and reviews are available for that product, then the corresponding page link is saved and reviews will be extracted from that product page.
          </font><br><br>

          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            If the product matches with our product and reviews are available for that product, then the corresponding page link is saved and reviews will be extracted from that product page.<br><br>
            [All]<br>
            www.amazon.com<br>
            www.buzzillions.com<br>
            www.rakuten.com<br>
            www.newegg.com<br>
            <br><br>
            [Electronics]<br>
            www.cnet.com
            <br><br>
            [Appliances]<br>
              www.wayfair.com<br>
              www.zappos.com<br>
              www.abt.com<br>

            www.reviews42.com

            www.hayneedle.com<br><br>
          </font>
          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            So, corresponding to each category i.e. electronics, appliances and computers, a few websites are taken as sample on which search will be made. [all] tag contains those websites on which products from all these categories can be found and not of any one category in specific. Similarly, [others] tag also contains the websites which has the products from all the categories and can be used for any category if required.
