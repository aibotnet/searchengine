        <font face="Arial" size="4">
        Tool   which  compare  our  product  with  product  listed   at different  sites  and  extract   reviews  for products of  our  organization . I used  python  and   it's libraries  for developing this tool.  After extracting reviews tool calculate   review  rating and generate the points(topics) which   is best   suited   feature for a particular product depending upon the reviews we are getting.

          <font size="5" style="color:darkblue;">Use of this Project</font><font size="5"><br></font>
        
          <font face="Arial" size="3">The project is about extracting REVIEWS for as  many products as possible falling under different categories. The project concentrates on the products shown at Nextag. For sameple i choosed 100 products.For All  products, there are no reviews and hence no Wize rating because product rating is calculated based on the customer reviews.Product rating is the rating calculated by the company for any product and rating of a product has a huge impact on the customer decision regarding that product and influences the customer opinion in a good way.<br><br>

          So, content-matching techniques were required using which we can match our products on any e-commerce site and then can extract the reviews from that site. In this way, reviews for more and more products can be gathered and displayed on our website which not only helps the customers in deciding whether they want to make a purchase or not but also helps the company in calculating the rating of the product which influences the customer decision a lot. The idea is not to be dependent on the urls provided by the merchants for reviews but to come up with a technique which can extract reviews from anywhere on the internet.</font><br>

        <p>
          <font size="5" style="color:darkblue;">Proposed Solution</font><font size="5"><br></font>
        
          <font face="Arial" size="3">We have introduced a PRODUCT MATCHING algorithm which does web scraping. The algorithm acts as a crawler i.e. it crawls different websites chosen by us. Then according to the technique implemented, the algorithm finds if the product that we are looking for is available at the chosen site or not. <br><br>

          If available, the algorithm matches the products available at that website with our product. It then calculates the matching percentage of the found product with our product to be sure about the product found that it is in fact the product that we were looking for. If the product is matched, then reviews for that product are extracted.</font><br>

          <font size="5" style="color:darkblue;">Project Overview</font><font size="5"><br></font>
          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            To start with, i have taken a few categories as sample from which the products will be chosen, they are:
          </font>
          </br><br>
            Electronics<br><br>
            Appliances<br><br>
            Computers<br><br>
          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            A few domains corresponding to each category mentioned above are chosen as sample so that our product can be searched on these websites and if found, reviews will be extracted from them.<br><br>

            Products are chosen from Nextag website. Their information is taken from the company database, whatever is required to search them on the sample websites, and a search is made on those sites. According to the search results, first few links of the search result are considered and product matching algorithm is applied on the products found on first few links to check whether the product found in the search results is what we needed or not. If there are no results found for the product that was searched then we move on to the next product for that website.
          </font><br><br>

          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            If the product matches with our product and reviews are available for that product, then the corresponding page link is saved and reviews will be extracted from that product page.
          </font><br><br>

          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            If the product matches with our product and reviews are available for that product, then the corresponding page link is saved and reviews will be extracted from that product page.<br><br>
            [All]<br>
            www.amazon.com<br>
            www.buzzillions.com<br>
            www.rakuten.com<br>
            www.newegg.com<br>
            <br><br>
            [Electronics]<br>
            www.cnet.com
            <br><br>

          </font>
          <font face="Arial" size="3">
            So, corresponding to each category i.e. electronics, appliances and computers, a few websites are taken as sample on which search will be made. [all] tag contains those websites on which products from all these categories can be found and not of any one category in specific. Similarly, [others] tag also contains the websites which has the products from all the categories and can be used for any category if required.
